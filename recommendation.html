The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who discovers a mysterious 
notebook: the "Death Note", which belonged to the Shinigami Ryuk, and 
grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is 
written in its pages. The series centers around Light's subsequent 
attempts to use the Death Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of 
individuals whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free society, 
using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent 
efforts of an elite Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective L, 
to apprehend him.</div>

In the aftermath of a great war, Violet Evergarden, a young female ex-soldier, 
gets a job at a writers' agency and goes on assignments to create letters that 
can connect people. After four long years of conflict, The Great War has finally 
come to an end. Caught up in the bloodshed was Violet Evergarden, a young girl 
raised to be a deadly weapon on the battlefield. Hospitalized and maimed in a 
bloody skirmish during the War's final leg, she was left with only words from 
the person she held dearest, but no understanding of their meaning. Recovering 
from her wounds, Violet starts a new life working at CH Postal Services. There, 
she witnesses by pure chance the work of an "Auto Memory Doll", amanuenses that 
transcribe people's thoughts and feelings into words on paper. Moved by the notion, 
Violet begins work as an Auto Memory Doll, a trade that will take her on an adventure, 
one that will reshape the lives of her clients and hopefully lead to self-discovery.</div>
